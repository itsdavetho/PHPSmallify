PHPSmallify
===========

PHPSmallify is a PHP minifier and obfuscator.
Under appropriate circumstances, PHPSmallify can effectively reduce the size of your code by 40-50%.

PHPSmallify was not originally intended to obfuscate code. It did not occur to me that obfuscation was more of a need than minification for most people (including myself).

The obfuscation features are in testing. They can handle most code thrown at them, but if you encounter any problems, please contact me.
